Introduction:

Filesys provides a very simple and lightweight way to give projects
access to the target operating system's filesystem. Namely this provides
a lighter alternative option to more bulky installations, such as 
Boost::filesystem

Installation:

Simply add the contents in /filesysSrc/ to your project. If the operating system
that you are compiling the project for is a Unix variant, include all the
source except the filesys_win.cpp. Likewise, if the target OS is
a version of Windows, include all files except for filesys_unix.cpp.


*Refer to filesys.h for more details on usage*
